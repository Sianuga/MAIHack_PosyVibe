🎛️ Part 1: Generate MIDI from Mood/EEG
You’ll likely extract a scalar mood signal (e.g. arousal/valence, or stress/relaxation levels) from EEG, so you want models that:

Accept conditioning (like mood tags)

Output structured, musically valid MIDI

Are Python-friendly and quick to use

🧠 MIDI Generation Options:
Tool	Summary	Input	Output	Notes
Magenta (MusicVAE, MelodyRNN)	Trained on melodic/4-bar sequences	Mood → latent vector	.mid	Stable, but limited genre-wise
MuseGAN	GAN for multi-track MIDI	Latent vector / label	.mid	Great for drums + harmony, not real-time
MusicGen (by Meta)	Text-to-music (audio, but can extract MIDI)	Mood text	Audio + tokens	Hugging Face version gives MIDI-like piano roll
Jukebox MIDI interface	(Experimental) generate symbolic embeddings	Text or audio prompt	Event stream	Slower + complex, not ideal for hackathon
MIR + rule-based systems	Use your own heuristics to map EEG → note density, mode, tempo	EEG data	.mid	Very explainable and fast to iterate

💡 My recommendation: Combine a small LSTM model (Magenta MelodyRNN) with rule-based tempo/scale control from your EEG-derived mood.

🎧 Part 2: Play MIDI and Render to Audio
Python options for turning MIDI → sound:

Tool	Method	Description	Realtime?
fluidsynth (via pyfluidsynth)	SF2 soundfont rendering	Best balance of quality + speed	✅
pygame.midi	Basic synth + playback	Works but janky and limited	✅
midi2audio (with Timidity++)	Renders .mid to .wav using CLI	Simple but not realtime	❌
pretty_midi + pyo / scamp	Full MIDI + synth combo	Great for expressive synths	✅
DAW via rtmidi or virtual MIDI loopback	Send MIDI to Ableton, FL, etc	High quality, but setup overhead	✅ (if local only)

Example: MIDI → audio with pyfluidsynth
python
Copy
Edit
import fluidsynth

fs = fluidsynth.Synth()
fs.start(driver="alsa")  # or 'coreaudio' on Mac, 'dsound' on Windows
sfid = fs.sfload("example.sf2")
fs.program_select(0, sfid, 0, 0)
fs.noteon(0, 60, 100)  # C4
time.sleep(1.0)
fs.noteoff(0, 60)
fs.delete()
You can also render a MIDI file to .wav:

python
Copy
Edit
from midi2audio import FluidSynth

FluidSynth().midi_to_audio('mood_output.mid', 'output.wav')
🧪 Bonus: Emotion-to-Music Mapping Ideas
EEG Feature	MIDI Control	Interpretation
Arousal (high)	Tempo ↑, note velocity ↑	Energetic music
Valence (low)	Key = minor, slow tempo	Sad or melancholic
Attention/focus ↑	More rhythmic density, less melodic variation	Trance-like
Relaxation ↑	Add reverb/sustain, pad instruments	Ambient vibe

You can use pretty_midi to control these programmatically.

Want me to:

Generate a boilerplate Python script that reads mood, generates MIDI, and plays it?

Add a simple web UI (e.g. Streamlit) that reflects mood and renders music?

Just say the word and I’ll wire it up.

Can you tell me a bit more about what I can do with pretty midi?
What kind of output are we looking at?
Can I do drums, pads, and synth?


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — pretty_midi is one of the best Python libraries for programmatic MIDI composition and manipulation. Think of it like the NumPy of MIDI: clean, flexible, and very hackable.

🎼 What is pretty_midi?
It’s a Python library built on top of mido and librosa for creating, editing, analyzing, and rendering MIDI data in a way that’s both musically expressive and precise.

🧠 What You Can Do With pretty_midi
✅ Create multi-instrument MIDI tracks
python
Copy
Edit
import pretty_midi

midi = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI()

# Add a pad (slow synth) on channel 0
pad = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=89)  # Warm Pad
pad.notes.append(pretty_midi.Note(velocity=80, pitch=60, start=0.0, end=2.0))
pad.notes.append(pretty_midi.Note(velocity=80, pitch=64, start=2.0, end=4.0))

# Add a kick drum (channel 9 = drums)
drums = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0, is_drum=True)
drums.notes.append(pretty_midi.Note(velocity=100, pitch=36, start=0.0, end=0.1))  # Kick
drums.notes.append(pretty_midi.Note(velocity=100, pitch=38, start=1.0, end=1.1))  # Snare

midi.instruments += [pad, drums]
midi.write('mood_music.mid')
✅ Manipulate timing, pitch, and expression
Change tempo (midi.estimate_tempo())

Shift all notes up/down (note.pitch += 12)

Add vibrato, glides, bends (using pitch bends or control changes)

✅ Analyze MIDI content
python
Copy
Edit
for note in midi.instruments[0].notes:
    print(f"Pitch: {note.pitch}, Start: {note.start}, Duration: {note.end - note.start}")
You can also get:

Total note density

Pitch histogram

Key/chord inference (via other libs like music21)

🪩 Can it do drums, pads, synths?
Yes, MIDI is just instructions — the sound comes from your synth engine (like FluidSynth or a DAW).

Drums = use channel 9 (is_drum=True) and General MIDI percussion notes

Pads = assign a program number for synth/pad sounds (e.g., 89 = "Pad 1 (New Age)")

Synth = program #81–88 for leads, bass, etc.

Example: MIDI instrument mapping (General MIDI)
Program #	Sound
0–7	Piano
40–47	Strings
80–87	Synth leads
88–95	Synth pads
115	Woodblock
118	Synth drum
Channel 9	Drums (kick = 36, snare = 38, hi-hat = 42 etc.)

🎧 Output & Rendering
Option 1: Save .mid and load in a DAW
python
Copy
Edit
midi.write('output.mid')
Option 2: Render to .wav using midi2audio
python
Copy
Edit
from midi2audio import FluidSynth
FluidSynth().midi_to_audio('output.mid', 'output.wav')
Option 3: Live playback with pyfluidsynth
python
Copy
Edit
import fluidsynth
fs = fluidsynth.Synth()
fs.start()
sfid = fs.sfload("your_soundfont.sf2")
fs.program_select(0, sfid, 0, 81)  # Synth lead
fs.noteon(0, 60, 100)
💡 Tip: Use pretty_midi + rule logic for mood-mapping
python
Copy
Edit
if mood == "relaxed":
    scale = [60, 62, 64, 65, 67, 69, 71]  # C major
    bpm = 70
elif mood == "tense":
    scale = [60, 61, 64, 66, 67, 70, 72]  # Phrygian
    bpm = 110

# Then generate melodies/harmony within that scale and tempo
Want a full mood → MIDI composer with multiple instruments?
I can build a script where you:

Feed in mood = "calm" or EEG = {"valence": 0.3, "arousal": 0.7}

Get a multi-track .mid with drums, pads, and a melody

Then render it to .wav

Let me know and I’ll scaffold it.







You said:
In pyfluidsynth what options for sounds do I have?


ChatGPT said:
Great question — in pyfluidsynth, the available sounds (instruments, timbres) come from the SoundFont (.sf2) file you load. Think of a SoundFont as a bank of sampled instruments, typically following the General MIDI (GM) standard.

🧱 Summary: What You Can Play in pyfluidsynth
✅ Instrument Sounds
You get up to 128 melodic instruments mapped to program numbers 0–127, and percussion sounds on channel 9 (drum channel).

These cover:

🎹 Pianos

🎸 Guitars & basses

🎻 Strings

🎷 Brass & woodwinds

🎧 Synth leads & pads

🥁 Drum kits (on channel 9 only)

🎹 General MIDI Program Numbers
Range	Category	Example
0–7	Piano	0 = Acoustic Grand Piano
24–31	Guitar	25 = Steel Guitar
32–39	Bass	33 = Fingered Bass
40–47	Strings	41 = Violin
56–63	Brass	57 = Trumpet
80–87	Synth Leads	81 = Lead 1 (Square)
88–95	Synth Pads	89 = Pad 1 (New Age)
96–103	FX	101 = Goblins
112–119	Percussive	118 = Synth Drum
Channel 9	Drums	36 = Kick, 38 = Snare, etc.

👉 Full list here: https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/gm-level-1-sound-set

🥁 Percussion (Drums) – Channel 9 Only
Use pitch values to trigger drum sounds:

Pitch	Drum Sound
35–36	Kick Drum
38–40	Snare
42–46	Hi-hats
49–57	Cymbals, Toms
60+	Percussion (bongos, congas, agogô, etc.)

Code Example:

python
Copy
Edit
fs.program_select(0, sfid, 0, 81)  # Synth Lead
fs.noteon(0, 60, 100)              # Middle C

fs.program_select(9, sfid, 128, 0)  # Drums on channel 9 (bank 128 is typical for percussion)
fs.noteon(9, 38, 127)              # Snare hit
🧰 Choosing SoundFonts
Popular GM-compatible .sf2 SoundFonts:

Name	Link	Notes
FluidR3 GM	preinstalled on many Linux systems	Very balanced, solid default
GeneralUser GS	S. Christian Collins	More expressive dynamics
FatBoy	GitHub	Very warm, open-source
Arachno SoundFont	Arachno.sf2	Rock-oriented, good synths

Make sure to load the .sf2 before playing anything:

python
Copy
Edit
sfid = fs.sfload("your_soundfont.sf2")
fs.program_select(0, sfid, 0, 81)  # channel 0, bank 0, program 81 (Lead 1)
🎛️ Bonus: Listing Available Instruments
You can't "list" instruments from the .sf2 using pyfluidsynth directly — but tools like Polyphone SoundFont Editor will let you inspect what instruments and drum kits are available in your .sf2.

Alternatively, you can hardcode from the General MIDI spec, like:

python
Copy
Edit
gm_instruments = {
    0: "Acoustic Grand Piano",
    25: "Steel String Guitar",
    33: "Fingered Bass",
    40: "Violin",
    56: "Trumpet",
    81: "Lead 1 (Square)",
    89: "Pad 1 (New Age)",
    118: "Synth Drum"
}
✅ TL;DR
You can play any GM-standard instrument with pyfluidsynth as long as your .sf2 includes it

Use program numbers 0–127 for melodic instruments, and channel 9 for drums

Sound quality and richness depend on your SoundFont — use FluidR3 or GeneralUser GS for best results

You can render live, or save .mid and convert to .wav with midi2audio
